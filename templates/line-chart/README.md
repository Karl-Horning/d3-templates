# Line Chart Example

This example demonstrates the creation of a Line Chart using JavaScript with the D3 library. The original [Line chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/line-chart/2) template is available on Observable, and the conversion from TypeScript includes the addition of JSDoc and comments for better understanding.

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the HTML file (in other words, `line-chart.html`) in a web browser.

## File Structure

- `line-chart.html`: HTML file containing the Line Chart implementation.
- `line-chart.js`: JavaScript file with the converted code from TypeScript, including JSDoc and comments.
- `data.js`: JavaScript file with the key data.
- `d3.v7.min.js`: D3 library version 7 minified file.
- `README.md`: This README file providing information about the example.

## Usage

Explore the `line-chart.js` file to understand how to create a Line Chart using D3.js. Customize the code and datasets to fit your specific requirements.
